# Regression tests for infra/schema-guard.sh's destructive-statement pattern.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The pattern decides whether production is allowed to deploy at all, and it
#   runs nowhere else: only on the server, against a live DB, mid-deploy. Both
#   ways it can be wrong are expensive and neither shows up in normal CI:
#
#     - too narrow -> a DROP COLUMN reaches prod unannounced;
#     - too broad  -> a purely additive change is refused and prod silently
#       falls behind. That is what happened: `(MODIFY|CHANGE)[^;]*NOT NULL` has
#       no trailing word boundary, so the enum value CHANGES_REQUESTED in
#       WeeklyReport's CREATE TABLE matched "CHANGE", the rest of the
#       line satisfied `[^;]*NOT NULL`, and prod stopped deploying while
#       preview kept going because it runs --warn-only.
#
#   So the fixtures below are real `prisma migrate diff --script` shapes, and
#   both directions are asserted — every genuinely destructive statement must
#   still match.
#
# USAGE
