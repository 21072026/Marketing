# Regression tests for infra/backup-db.sh's dump validation.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The validation block is the part of the backup that decides "is this dump
#   real?", and it is the part with no natural coverage: it only runs on a
#   deploy, against a live DB, on the server. It shipped with a bug that made it
#   reject every dump larger than a pipe buffer — `grep -q` exits at the first
#   match, `gzip` dies of SIGPIPE, and `set -o pipefail` fails the pipeline. Prod
#   could not deploy for a day, and the small test DB it was written against
#   could never have caught it, because the bug needs SIZE to show up.
#
#   So these tests feed the checks dumps of a realistic size. A fixture small
#   enough to be convenient is a fixture that proves nothing here.
#
# USAGE
#   bash infra/test/backup-db.test.sh
