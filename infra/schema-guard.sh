# Destructive schema-change gate.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   This project syncs with `prisma db push --accept-data-loss` and has no
#   migrations/ folder, so there is no natural review point where a human sees
#   "this drops a column". A PR that renames a field reads as a rename in the
#   diff and lands as a DROP + ADD in production.
#
#   This script asks Prisma what SQL the pending push would actually run
#   (`migrate diff --script`, which PRINTS the SQL and writes no files), looks
#   for statements that destroy data, and stops the deploy when it finds any.
#
# USAGE
#   RUN_TOOL="docker run --rm -e DATABASE_URL=... $IMAGE" ./infra/schema-guard.sh [--warn-only]
#   ./infra/schema-guard.sh                      # uses npx directly
#
#   ENV VARS
#     DATABASE_URL       (required)
#     RUN_TOOL           command prefix used to run prisma (default: npx)
#     ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE  set to 1 to proceed anyway — an operator decision
#     BACKUP_TAKEN       set to 1 by the caller when a fresh backup exists;
#                        ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE is refused without it
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0 = safe (or warn-only, or explicitly allowed)   1 = destructive, stopping

# Statements that lose data. Kept as one grep -E alternation, deliberately

#   TRUNCATE                     — wipes rows outright
#   MODIFY/CHANGE ... NOT NULL   — fails or coerces existing NULL rows

# any identifier that merely STARTS with "change" matches, and the rest of the
# line then satisfies `[^;]*NOT NULL` on its own — so a purely additive
# CREATE TABLE was rejected for containing an enum value named
# CHANGES_REQUESTED, blocking production deploys while
# preview sailed through on --warn-only. Blunt is fine; matching a substring of
# a column value is not.
