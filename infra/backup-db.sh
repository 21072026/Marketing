#
# Database backup.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Every merge to main deploys, and every deploy runs
#   `prisma db push --accept-data-loss` (infra/deploy-prod.sh). That flag means
#   exactly what it says: a renamed or removed column is DROPPED without asking.
#   Until this script existed there was no backup anywhere in the repo, so one
#   careless schema edit could destroy the product's only differentiator — the
#   accumulated interaction log, evaluations and stage history — with no way
#   back. The most valuable moment to hold a copy is therefore the instant
#   BEFORE the schema sync; a daily run covers everything else (a bad bulk
#   delete, a disk failure).
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   mysqldump → gzip → $BACKUP_DIR/<env>-<stamp>.sql.gz, then sanity-checks the
#   size and prunes anything older than $KEEP_DAYS.
#
# USAGE
#   DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:pass@host:3306/db ./infra/backup-db.sh [--env prod] [--stamp 20260806T2312Z]
#
#   ENV VARS

#     BACKUP_DIR    default /var/backups/salevali-crm
#     KEEP_DAYS     default 7
#     MIN_BYTES     default 1024 — a smaller dump is treated as a failed one
#
# THE DUMPS CONTAIN REAL PERSONAL DATA (CVs, phone numbers, mentor notes).
# The directory is created 0700 and the files 0600. Never copy one into the
# repo, a preview environment, or a ticket.
